Any linear equation in one variable has the form aX + b = cX + d. Here the value of X is to be found, when the values of a, b, c, d are given.

A program to solve a linear equation in one variable is as follows âˆ’

Example
Live Demo

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   float a, b, c, d, X;
   cout<<"The form of the linear equation in one variable is: aX + b = cX + d"<<endl;
   cout<<"Enter the values of a, b, c, d : "<<endl;
   cin>>a>>b>>c>>d;
   cout<<"The equation is "<<a<<"X + "<<b<<" = "<<c<<"X + "<<d<<endl;
   
   if(a==c && b==d)
      cout<<"There are infinite solutions possible for this equation"<<endl;
   else if(a==c)
      cout<<"This is a wrong equation"<<endl;
   else {
      X = (d-b)/(a-c);
      cout<<"The value of X = "<< X <<endl;
   }
}
